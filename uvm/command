# Following command compiles and simulates, at time zero. The task run_test (present in top.sv) features the test name from the command line by +UVM_TESTNAME=<test_name> argument. It looks up testname in the factory and tells the factory to construct the object

# run.f contains packages, interface and top module. Specify the name of test that you want to run by +UVM_TESTNAME
# Check separate command for compile, optimize and simulate

# UVM_INFO tx_test.sv(82) @ 0: uvm_test_top [tx_test] [INFO MESSAGE] Test message with verbosity NONE
# You can shorten the displayed message by removing file name and line number by switch +define+UVM_REPORT_DISABLE_FILE_LINE. In above line tx_test.sv is file name
# You can also change default verbosity value by switch +UVM_VERBOSITY
# In raise and drop objection there are messages like "End tx_sequence" but these messages are not printed to print such messages in raise and drop objections, you can use +UVM_OBJECTION_TRACE switch to print these message in the log.
